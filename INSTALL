LosF: A Linux operating system Framework for managing HPC clusters
-------------------------------------------------------------------

LosF is presently designed to work with Cobbler
(http://www.cobblerd.org), which is used to perform bare-metal
provisioning. If you want to use LosF to manage the Cobbler
provisioning mechanism, you will need to identify at least one master
host on your cluster to serve as the provisioning server. If your
master server has external network access, you can download the
necessary packages to setup Cobbler from the EPEL repository
(https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL). There are many resources
available online regarding EPEL, a quickstart method which works with
CentOS distributions is as follows:

1. Register your master server with EPEL

$ yum install cobbler
$ yum install yum-plugin-downloadonly


LosF Requirements:

$ yum install perl-Log-Log4perl
$ yum install perl-Config-IniFiles
